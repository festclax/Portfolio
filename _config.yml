  Making meaning out of numbers and painting stories with graphics is my passion.
  I see things mostly from a data point of view.
  I hold a Bachelors degree in Applied Statistics with strong passion for analysis.
  <b><b>
  right from my final year days in the university, I have been working with statistical data analysis.
  I remember one of the B.Sc. thesis I did for a Biochemistry final year student on the "The Effect Of Calcium Intake
  On Lactating Mothers." I used SPSS and MATLAB to carry out a Correlation analysis with data visualization that 
  gave that thesis project an exellent result.

  From Banking to Business, and now in NGO, I have remained a data enthusiast.

  I work professionaly with Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python, SPSS, and MATLAB.

  I am here to help you make hidden truth visible.
